# Booking-System_A3

I'm going to work on a skeleton of a simple booking system. The idea is for
customers to book appointments with an employee. The overview of the system is
illustrated below. For now, we ignore the greyed-out parts.

I decided to made this assignment in C#, because it will be more exciting to convert a Java project into C#. One thing I decided to not use was Entity Framework, which would disrupt the  Java architecture.

The tests cover 90% of the code. This is due to me not testing the SMS message class, which I didn't find important because the SMS class doesn't really accomplish anything at the moment.

Test Results:
